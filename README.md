# Pac-Man
a classic game Pac-Man programmed in Python with Pygame library. <br>
Game is fully resizable and has power ups. However bots act purely random and do not take players possition into consideration. <br>
*Note some rules of Pac Man have been changed, for example player cant turn 180 and player cant just stop moving by aiming him self at a wall.
